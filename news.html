            <p class = "news-text">
                People have been protesting Tree Scaree Tails. I interviewed the CEO of MemeFlix for this.
                When I asked him if they were protesting because of the lack of quality of the movie, he responded no.
                He said that they were protesting since the movie was too scary, especially last tail. After watching
                the movie, I can verify this. I have also become a new protester, and hopefully, the movie will be 
                taken down very soon.

                MemeFlix has recently kidnapped Louis Hess as a game developer. He is currently working on a 
                game about Moby in a haunted mansion stuck with other deformed connors.
