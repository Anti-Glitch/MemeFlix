                A new MemeFlix series will be released very soon. The series will come in different episodes,
                and will be shorter than your average movie. The series is called, "moby is bored", and will
                probably feature moby being bored.

            <p class = "news-text">
                There have been rumors on the streets that there will soon be a game for Demon Baby.
                This game will still have the same low-budget quality of the movie. The CEO is reported to 
                have said, "I don't know why I decided the stuff. Just movie + game = more money. I guess. Sorta."
                The company developing the game is the infamous, Lous inc. The game's release date is still
                unown.

            <h3 class = "news-heading">First person hired</h3>
            <p class = "news-text">
                MemeFlix has recently hired Louis Hess as a professional game developer.
                Currenly, he is working on Demon Baby : The Game. No other information
                is required. We can only hope that the game turns out to have the same
                quality as the movie, crappy, and that the game has tons of blood.

            <h3 class = "news-heading">New Games to come</h3>
            <p class = "news-text">
                Several new games will be coming out now. This includes Demon Baby : The Game,
                Furry Virus : Birth, and the Rabbit and the Tortoise. I estimate that the rabbit 
                and the tortoise will be the first one coming out, since it is made in block language,
                not written language. The 2nd one following will probably be Demon Baby since it is 
                made in Unity2D. The last one coming out will probably be Furry Virus, since it
                is going to be made in Unity3D.
                Signing off, Unity Gang. P.S. Screw Unreal Gang.
