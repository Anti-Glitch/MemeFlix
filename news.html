            <p class = "news-text">
                People have been protesting Tree Scaree Tails. I interviewed the CEO of MemeFlix for this.
                When I asked him if they were protesting because of the lack of quality of the movie, he responded no.
                He said that they were protesting since the movie was too scary, especially the last tail. After watching
                the movie, I can verify this. I have also become a new protester, and hopefully, the movie will be 
                taken down very soon.

            <p class = "news-text">
                At a recent Loser Larry convention, a couple of teenage Savage Samuels walked up
                and beat up the Larrys. It was hiLarryious. Unsurprisingly, the police soon arrived
                and joined in with the Savage Samuels. The president himself arrived just to get the
                experience of beating up the losers with the savages. The losers were having a convention
                about how being a loser doesn't mean that you can't beat up other ranks. After this 
                event, the losers moved one rank down, becoming even worse than the Certified Wimps.
