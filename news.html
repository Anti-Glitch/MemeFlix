            <h3 class = "news-heading">Possible MemeFlix Devleopers edition coming up</h3>
            <p class = "news-text">
                The CEO of MemeFlix has recently revealed that there might be a MemeFlix developers
                edition coming up. The new version would include multiple tutorials on making hopscotch
                movies and games. He says, "I just did this so <em>I</em> wouldn't have to work as hard 
                and make as much movies every day. This would allow MemeFlix to have multiple studios making movies at once."
                To register, you need to be a citizen of the Meme Slides. Second, you need to log in to the
                MemeFlix account. You can ask Martin for both of those. Another thing he hinted at was coconut bucket.

            <p class = "news-text">
                People have been protesting Tree Scaree Tails. I interviewed the CEO of MemeFlix for this.
                When I asked him if they were protesting because of the lack of quality of the movie, he responded no.
                He said that they were protesting since the movie was too scary, especially last tail. After watching
                the movie, I can verify this. I have also become a new protester, and hopefully, the movie will be 
                taken down very soon.

            <p class = "news-text">
                There have been rumors on the streets that there will soon be a game for Demon Baby.
                This game will still have the same low-budget quality of the movie. The CEO is reported to 
                have said, "I don't know why I decided the stuff. Just movie + game = more money. I guess. Sorta."
                The company developing the game is the infamous, Lous inc. The game's release date is still
                unown.
